Hi, I'm Graham Mather. I'm currently a software engineer intern at Alert Innovation. I'm experienced with backend technologies such as MongoDB, GraphQL, RESTApi, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. I am currently working on learning React and Tailwind through a web project that pulls and displays player data in the game TFT using Riots developer API. I love learning new technologies and am working toward becoming a developer that can build any idea that pops into my head.
