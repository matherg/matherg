Hi, I'm Graham Mather. I'm currently a freelance developer working on Cait's Curates, a gift reccomendation website. I'm experienced with backend technologies such as MongoDB, GraphQL, RESTApi, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. My current favorite tech stack is Vite+React, Tailwind, Go and PostgreSQL I love learning new technologies and am working toward becoming a developer that can build any idea that pops into my head.
